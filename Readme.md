## Sample Usage
The repository contains a sample project named **OpenAI.Playground** to help you understand how the library works. However, please exercise caution while experimenting, as some test methods may result in unintended consequences such as file deletion or fine-tuning.

*!! It is highly recommended that you use a separate account instead of your primary account while using the playground. Some test methods may add or delete your files and models, potentially causing unwanted issues. !!*

Your API Key can be obtained from here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  
Your Organization ID can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings

### Without Using Dependency Injection
```csharp
var openAIService = new OpenAIService(new OpenAIOptions()
{
    ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY")
});
```

### Using Dependency Injection

#### secrets.json
```json
"OpenAIServiceOptions": {
    "ApiKey": "Your api key goes here",
    "Organization": "Your Organization Id goes here (optional)",
    "UseBeta": "true/false (optional)"
}
```
*(To use [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows): Right-click your project name in "Solution Explorer", then click "Manage User Secrets". This is a good way to keep your API keys secure.)*

#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService();
```

**OR**

```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService(settings => { settings.ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"); });
```

After injecting your service, you can retrieve it from the service provider:
```csharp
var openAiService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOpenAIService>();
```

You can set a default model (optional):
```csharp
openAiService.SetDefaultModelId(Models.Gpt_4o);
```

## Chat GPT Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = await openAiService.ChatCompletion.CreateCompletion(new ChatCompletionCreateRequest
{
    Messages = new List<ChatMessage>
    {
        ChatMessage.FromSystem("You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Who won the world series in 2020?"),
        ChatMessage.FromAssistant("The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Where was it played?")
    },
    Model = Models.Gpt_4o,
});
if (completionResult.Successful)
{
    Console.WriteLine(completionResult.Choices.First().Message.Content);
}
```

Needless to say, I cannot accept responsibility for any damage caused by using the library.
