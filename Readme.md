## Sample Usage
The repository contains a sample project named **OpenAI.Playground** to help you understand how the library works. However, please exercise caution while experimenting, as some test methods may result in unintended consequences such as file deletion or fine-tuning.

*!! It is highly recommended that you use a separate account instead of your primary account while using the playground. Some test methods may add or delete your files and models, potentially causing unwanted issues. !!*

Your API Key can be obtained from here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys  
Your Organization ID can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings

### Without Using Dependency Injection
```csharp
var openAIService = new OpenAIService(new OpenAIOptions()
{
    ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY")
});
```

### Using Dependency Injection

#### secrets.json
```json
"OpenAIServiceOptions": {
    "ApiKey": "Your api key goes here",
    "Organization": "Your Organization Id goes here (optional)",
    "UseBeta": "true/false (optional)"
}
```
*(To use [user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows): Right-click your project name in "Solution Explorer", then click "Manage User Secrets". This is a good way to keep your API keys secure.)*

#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService();
```

**OR**

```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService(settings => { settings.ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"); });
```

After injecting your service, you can retrieve it from the service provider:
```csharp
var openAiService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOpenAIService>();
```

You can set a default model (optional):
```csharp
openAiService.SetDefaultModelId(Models.Gpt_4o);
```

## Chat GPT Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = await openAiService.ChatCompletion.CreateCompletion(new ChatCompletionCreateRequest
{
    Messages = new List<ChatMessage>
    {
        ChatMessage.FromSystem("You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Who won the world series in 2020?"),
        ChatMessage.FromAssistant("The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Where was it played?")
    },
    Model = Models.Gpt_4o,
});
if (completionResult.Successful)
{
    Console.WriteLine(completionResult.Choices.First().Message.Content);
}
```

## Notes
Due to time constraints, not all methods have been thoroughly tested or fully documented. If you encounter any issues, please report them or submit a pull request. Your contributions are always appreciated.

Needless to say, I cannot accept responsibility for any damage caused by using the library.

## Changelog
### 8.10.0
- Added support for `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator` (more information will be coming soon to the Wiki).
- Added missing `Temperature` and `TopP` parameters to `AssistantResponse`.
- Added missing `Store` parameter to `ChatCompletionCreateRequest`.

- Breaking Changes:
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `CreatedAt` parameter renamed to `CreatedAtUnix` and converted to `long` instead of `int`. Added `CreatedAt` parameter as `DateTimeOffset` type, which will automatically convert Unix time to `DateTime`.

### 8.9.0
- Realtime API implementation is completed. As usual this is the first version and it may contain bugs. Please report any issues you encounter.
- [Realtime Sample](https://github.com/betalgo/openai/wiki/realtime)

### 8.8.0

- **Compatibility Enhancement**: You can now use this library alongside the official OpenAI library and/or Semantic Kernel within the same project. The name changes in this update support this feature.

- **Namespace and Package ID Update**: The namespace and PackageId have been changed from `Betalgo.OpenAI` to `Betalgo.Ranul.OpenAI`.

- **OpenAI Naming Consistency**: We've standardized the use of "OpenAI" throughout the library, replacing any instances of "OpenAi" or other variations.

- **Migration Instructions**: Intellisense should assist you in updating your code. If it doesn't, please make the following changes manually:
  - Switch to the new NuGet package: `Betalgo.Ranul.OpenAI` instead of `Betalgo.OpenAI`.
  - Update all namespaces from `OpenAI` to `Betalgo.Ranul.OpenAI`.
  - Replace all occurrences of "OpenAi", "Openai", or any other variations with "OpenAI".

- **Need Help?**: If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out via our Discord channel, Reddit channel, or GitHub discussions. We're happy to assist.

- **Feedback Welcomed**: If you notice any mistakes or missing name changes, please create an issue to let us know.

- **Utilities Library Status**: Please note that the Utilities library might remain broken for a while. I will focus on fixing it after completing the real-time API implementation.
